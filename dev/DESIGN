Plan to create a more general 2D drawing
option with an ASCI input file:

in-units: in cm m f mm
out-units
scale: x per 

# define points by number or name
point: 1 x y
point: a x y

# adverbs for shapes
lw N # line width in PS points
d N  # diameter

# shapes
poly: # 2 or more points with closure from last to first to last
line: # 2 named points 
linea: # 1 named point plus: ang X len Y (in either order)


rect: 1 2 3 4 # either direction
tri: 1 2 3    # either direction
ell: a b # create options for entering x and y bounds, orientation angle, etc.
circ:
